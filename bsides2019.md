### Puzzle 10
    - clue: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  (there's no clue!)
    
take all the 'random' tags and use the cipher disk at the bottom of the puzzle to decrypt it. __The Shadow knows. Find his letter, with a *look* of a 'time' answers told__

recall: when you get the solution to one of the puzzles, the box on the instructions/clues page gets punched out. Notice, that the logo and title text are reversed on that page as well. Notice, when you fold the paper down the middle the logo and icons match up with the puzzle page. Also notice, the punched out holes match up with every other letter going down the left side of the puzzle.
      
Take these letters and run them through the wheel at the bottom of the page. __four fourty__
      
Search for a cipher from [The Shadow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow), notice that some of the symbols look like clock faces. Find the clock face that appears to be set to 4:40. The answer is 'b' (as in B-Sides)
