  <p>Recently I volunteered to fix a friends iMac, the symptoms were Safari running extremely slowly, causing system freezes. Oddly enough, Firefox worked happily along with no issues. I thought, “maybe the software is out of date, perhaps a new version of Safari would fix this, or maybe some software has caused a conflict somehow.” In attempting to update the OS, the disk failed. “Well,” I thought, “that explains the system freezes”. The following are the steps I took to recover the data and bring back the OS.</p>
  <p>First, I contacted my friend (let’s call him Aaron) to garner any assistance he could provide, he works with Apples’ more frequently than I, so I figured that would be a great starting place. After some help from him for various ways to update and run live OSX utilities from install disks I set out to recover the data. Thank you friend “Aaron”.</p>
  <p>First I tried SpinRite, the keyboard did not work! It turns out that it does not work on Apples due to the EFI rather than BIOS being used on on Macs.</p>
  <p>“The INT’s from BIOS are used also to access the disks, so all the methods need to be translated to EFI”</p>

  <p>Excerpt from Security Now #293:</p>
  <blockquote>
  I wish I could easily get the hard drive out of my iMac, it's a real pain, because my son's hard drive crashed.  And I'm sure I could put it in a PC, SpinRite it, and it would all be fine.  But the iMac, the big negative, you have to actually take suction cups and remove the glass.  It's very - it's ridiculous.  Colleen did it, she's got more nerve than I did, some time ago when the hard drive on my iMac here died.  And I remember watching her do it.  And I thought, oh, geez.  Oh, geez.  I ain't doing that.  No user-serviceable parts inside there.
  </blockquote>
  <p>Thus I knew the only way to SpinRite it would be removing the glass front with suction cups... I’d rather not.</p>
  <p>I opted for an Ubuntu install disk instead. Booting into Ubuntu worked great, the problem was the 2TB Seagate GoFlex I had to transfer the files to was unreadable due to permissions that Ubuntu respects. After some Googleing I found instructions for allowing read/write access to the HFS+ file system Apple uses. <a target="_blank" href="http://mac.linux.be/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=95">(here)</a> For Ubuntu, the instructions linked to are pretty much the same. However, when I logged back in as the Ubuntu live user, I could not make a new folder to back up the bad drive to on the Seagate. It turns out, Ubuntu cannot write to HFS+ unless it is non- journaled. To disable journaling, one must boot to the OSX install disk, start the Disk Utility, then hold the command key and click File->Disable Journaling. <a target="_blank" href="http://superuser.com/questions/84446/how-to-mount-a-hfs-partition-in-ubuntu-as-read-write">(source)</a></p>
  
  <dl>
  <dt>To conclude, when you need to get data from an iMac to a journaled HFS+ external drive, follow these steps:</dt>
  <dd>
  <dl><dt>Boot to Mac OSX install disk</dt>
  <dd><a target="_blank" href="http://guides.macrumors.com/Mac_doesn't_boot">http://guides.macrumors.com/Mac_doesn't_boot</a></dd>
  <dd>Start with step 5</dd>

  <dt>Disable journaling</dt>
