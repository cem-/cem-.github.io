  </header>
  <p>Today, Apple released security advisory <a href="http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203119" target="_blank">APPLE-SA-2014-10-20-1</a> for iOS 8.1 that includes <a href="https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-4449" target="_blank">CVE-2014-4449</a>.</p>
  <p>This relates to a TLS certificate validation vulnerability in the clients accessing iCloud affecting bookmarks, calendar, tasks, and possibly other data types allowing for modification and disclosure of data.</p>
  <p>Exposure of sensitive reminders, meetings, bookmarks (including bookmarklets that could allow logins to other saved websites). Users may store sensitive data within these data objects that are synced to iCloud, these are at risk of exposure through this vulnerability.</p>

  <p><i>--speculation ahead--</i><br />According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwmmLRUYaQ8" target="_blank">ElcomSoft</a>, a Russian mobile forensics company, the data gathered from the MobileMe-Auth Token might be able to be used to get additional authentication tokens as well as a number of other interesting things like iOS iCloud backups. These are encrypted using retrievable keys that are also stored in the cloud.</p>
  <p>So, assumedly, one executing an attack on CVE-2014-4449, would have the ability to not only see just the data going over the unauthenticated streams to the calendar, reminders, and bookmarks, but also could pivot those authentication keys to download and decrypt backups of iOS devices. Once a backup is retrieved and decrypted the attacker has access to all of the iPhone data using a variety of free or paid tools for forensic analysis.</p>

	  <time class="pubdate" datetime="2013-10-28">2013-10-28</time>

  </header>
  <p>One of the things that a corporation, website, or mobile application should do, is in all of its interactions with the users of its services insure that none of the actions that it requests or requires would be something that in a malicious context would compromise the security those users.</p>
  <p>You should not do things like: have users enter credentials over a non-SSL log-in screen, force users to click through an invalid certificate to get to your site, or use a pseudo-public piece of data for a password (e.g. SSN or birthday).</p>
  <p>Last week, LinkedIn broke the rule of not requiring the user to engage in risky behavior. The service <a target="_blank" href="http://engineering.linkedin.com/mobile/linkedin-intro-doing-impossible-ios">Intro</a> is described as a <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.csoonline.com/application-security/2808/linkedin-intro-data-meet-security-issues">bad idea</a> by Dave Lewis <a target="_blank" href="http://threatpost.com/linkedin-intro-app-equivalent-to-man-in-the-middle-attack-experts/">and</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/linkedins-new-mobile-app-called-a-dream-for-attackers/">others</a>, was <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2013/10/26/the-facts-about-linkedin-intro/">rebutted</a> by a LinkedIn security manager which sparked a reply by Martin McKeay. Up to now, I have seen many people talking about how bad an idea the system is as a whole, so I will not rehash that part. Instead, I want to focus on the <i>how</i> not the what.</p>
  <p>Which brings me back to forcing users to engage in risky behavior. The way that you 'install' Intro, is to first, go to the Intro website rather than the app store. One of iOS's most lauded features is that it is kept more secure only allowing apps from the app store. Getting an app or 'app' from elsewhere should raise red flags.</p>
  <p>Next, you enter in your Gmail/iCloud/Yahoo/AOL/etc. email password, on LinkedIn's site. You should not enter your password for one site on another. It is reasonable for sites to want functionality that would normally need other sites credentials, but this is why things like <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">oAuth</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0">SAML</a> were created.</p>
  <p>Next, you are required to install a <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/featuredarticles/iPhoneConfigurationProfileRef/">configuration profile</a>. Configuration profiles very useful for giving corporations access to a phone. As <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bishopfox.com/blog/2013/10/linkedin-intro/">Bishop Fox said</a>, "A profile can be used to wipe your phone, install applications, delete applications, restrict functionality, and a whole heap of other things". Users should only install these profiles if they truly understand what they do, or are required to by their company.</p>
  <p>Also, using this method, there is a set of certificates installed by the mobile config profile. This is a further potential avenue for compromise in a malicious setting. Configuration profiles in iOS are powerful things, training users to install them can lead to making it a lot easier to pull off a social engineering trick, similar to what I described in my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cem.me/papers/bslides.pptx">BSides San Antonio talk</a> (starting slide 26).</p>
  <p>Make the Internet a better place: as a website/app/service provider you should choose an architecture using methods that propagate more secure, rather than risky, behavior.</p>
  <p>Happy Cyber Security Awareness Month</p>

  </header>
  <p>The problem: brand new Windows 8 install, Bluetooth not working, not present in device manager. All drivers updated, BIOS updated, manufacturer software installed...</p>
  <p>The hardware: Lenovo ThinkPad T500, Broadcom Bluetooth</p>
  <p>When I upgraded my Windows 7 install to Windows 8, I choose the option that did not keep any files or settings (in order to have a clean install). My Bluetooth when I began the process was turned off, and as the hardware was shut off in the settings, apparently Windows 8 was unable to even find the existence of the Bluetooth modem. It was not present in device manager, thus I was unable to install drivers for it. Therefore, I postulated, if I could somehow get the hardware turned on, Windows 8 would be able to see it.</p>
  <p>To turn on the Bluetooth modem, I created an Ubuntu USB drive, booted to that, verified that the Bluetooth was turned on, then rebooted to the Windows install. As I expected, the Bluetooth modem stayed on, and I am now able to turn the Bluetooth on and off via the Windows settings UI.</p>
  <p>My advice, just in case, make sure you turn on Bluetooth before you upgrade...</p>

  </header>
  <p>Today I created a webapp that allows for sysadmins and security savvy chrome users to add certificate pins to their sites and browser.</p>

<p>Give it a try over at <a target="_blank" href="https://certpins.appspot.com/">https://certpins.appspot.com/</a>.</p>
<p>Certificate pinning is a way to tell clients what cert or CA they should be seeing when they connect to your website. The tool builds upon the go implementation of cert pinning in the key-pinning draft.</p>

<p><b>EDIT:</b></p>
<p>I've called this certificate pinning even though the process is key pinning because the app that creates the key pins specifically only takes certificates to make the pins. Regardless of semantics, enjoy the app for creating key pins.</p>

	  <time class="pubdate" datetime="2012-07-28">2012-07-28</time>

  </header>
  <p>Recently I volunteered to fix a friends iMac, the symptoms were Safari running extremely slowly, causing system freezes. Oddly enough, Firefox worked happily along with no issues. I thought, “maybe the software is out of date, perhaps a new version of Safari would fix this, or maybe some software has caused a conflict somehow.” In attempting to update the OS, the disk failed. “Well,” I thought, “that explains the system freezes”. The following are the steps I took to recover the data and bring back the OS.</p>
  <p>First, I contacted my friend (let’s call him Aaron) to garner any assistance he could provide, he works with Apples’ more frequently than I, so I figured that would be a great starting place. After some help from him for various ways to update and run live OSX utilities from install disks I set out to recover the data. Thank you friend “Aaron”.</p>
  <p>First I tried SpinRite, the keyboard did not work! It turns out that it does not work on Apples due to the EFI rather than BIOS being used on on Macs.</p>
  <p>“The INT’s from BIOS are used also to access the disks, so all the methods need to be translated to EFI”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Steve Gibson</p>
  <p>Excerpt from Security Now #293:</p>
  <blockquote>
  I wish I could easily get the hard drive out of my iMac, it's a real pain, because my son's hard drive crashed.  And I'm sure I could put it in a PC, SpinRite it, and it would all be fine.  But the iMac, the big negative, you have to actually take suction cups and remove the glass.  It's very - it's ridiculous.  Colleen did it, she's got more nerve than I did, some time ago when the hard drive on my iMac here died.  And I remember watching her do it.  And I thought, oh, geez.  Oh, geez.  I ain't doing that.  No user-serviceable parts inside there.
  </blockquote>
  <p>Thus I knew the only way to SpinRite it would be removing the glass front with suction cups... I’d rather not.</p>
  <p>I opted for an Ubuntu install disk instead. Booting into Ubuntu worked great, the problem was the 2TB Seagate GoFlex I had to transfer the files to was unreadable due to permissions that Ubuntu respects. After some Googleing I found instructions for allowing read/write access to the HFS+ file system Apple uses. <a target="_blank" href="http://mac.linux.be/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=95">(here)</a> For Ubuntu, the instructions linked to are pretty much the same. However, when I logged back in as the Ubuntu live user, I could not make a new folder to back up the bad drive to on the Seagate. It turns out, Ubuntu cannot write to HFS+ unless it is non- journaled. To disable journaling, one must boot to the OSX install disk, start the Disk Utility, then hold the command key and click File->Disable Journaling. <a target="_blank" href="http://superuser.com/questions/84446/how-to-mount-a-hfs-partition-in-ubuntu-as-read-write">(source)</a></p>

  <p>If you remember a few years ago, moxie was able to go grab a few wildcard certs, good for any domain (*, *.com, *.*.com, etc...), they were revoked, so he figured out a way to confuse the client into not checking for revocation (by sending a spoofed 'busy, please wait' signal back to the client). But, now it seems that at least one of those revoked certs has been allowed to be renewed via poorly written CA software. Now, he once again has a nice wildcard cert available for use.</p>
  <blockquote><p><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/jchillerup">@jchillerup</a> I dunno, but a CA recently sent me a renewal notice for expiring (revoked) null-prefix certs. I clicked, they renewed.</p>&mdash; Moxie Marlinspike (@moxie) <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/moxie/status/137976502498242560">November 19, 2011</a></blockquote>
  <p>This isn't the first sign of poor CA web apps that were written to ease the load on persons running the CAs, or on the people requesting the certificates. You can tell that the so named, 'ComodoHacker' that procured certs for DigiNotar and the Comodo subsidiary used a flaw in the web app. If you look at the private keys that he generated, they have the extra tidbits that CAs inject into the certs Distinguished Name, as well as the revocation server data. If you wanted to steal a cert, wouldn't want it to be un-revoke-able by leaving out any valid revocation information? Would you not want to leave out the unique identifier that allows one looking at the DN to see it was a DigiNotar cert?</p>
  <p>CAs either need to really work on shoring up their webapps, or the CA Browser Forum needs to revoke their approval status due to use of vulnerable webapps. (This approval would come from the CAs paying for vulnerability tests with an internal and external perview)</p>

  <p>Google indexes a lot of stuff, people put a lot of stuff on the internet. what happens when someone puts a private key on a server without making sure it does not (or could not) get indexed...</p>
  <code>filetype:key +"RSA PRIVATE KEY"</code>
<p>also try:</p>
<code>filetype:pem +"RSA PRIVTE KEY"</code>
<p>it is amazing how open some servers are....</p>

<p>In the previous post, i mentioned that I would have some uses for the smsme script that I wrote. Here's a script that checks your external IP address against what you have registered in the DNS system, and alerts you when the address changes.</p>
<p>Also, I've included instructions for creating a user cron job to check every hour on the hour.</p>
<code>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
#!/bin/bash<br />
DNS=`nslookup cem.me 8.8.8.8 | grep 'Address: ' | grep -Eo '[0-9\.]+'`<br />
EXTIP=`wget -q -O - http://checkip.dyndns.org | grep -Eo '[0-9\.]+'`<br />
if [ $DNS != $EXTIP ] ;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;`/home/username/bin/smsme IP CHANGED: $EXTIP`<br />
fi<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
</code>

<p>The DNS command goes to Google’s DNS, pipes the output to search for 'Address:' followed by a space, and then pulls out the IP address.</p>
<p>The EXTIP goes to http://checkip.dyndns.org and parses out your IP</p>
<br />
<p>To create the cron job, create a new file (crontab.&lt;username&gt;.file) and enter in the text below:</p>
<code>0 * * * * /home/&lt;username&gt;/bin/checkip.sh</code>
<br />
<p>This line says (in the 0 * * * *) part to run on the hour (00), every hour (*), every day (*), every month(*), every day of the week(*) and will run our script that we wrote above (/home/&lt;username&gt;/bin/checkip.sh) make sure you replace the &lt;username&gt; part with your username</p>
<br />
<code>
#this allows your user to run cron jobs<br />
sudo su<br />
echo &lt;username&gt; &gt;&gt;/etc/cron.allow<br />
exit<br />
<br />
#set cron<br />
crontab crontab.&lt;username&gt;.file<br />
<br />
#view to confirm<br />
crontab -l<br />
</code>

  <p>So, my email being sent using the (Ubuntu) Linux was being blocked by the ISP, Gmail, and other mail servers (Exchange) therefore, I decided to find an alternative way to get alerts from my server. Enter Google Voice and their SMS feature. I found that I can send text messages to myself, thus allowing for instantaneous alerting of events. &lt;the following assumes that you are running ubuntu&gt;</p>
<br />
<p>first run these commands:</p>
<code>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
sudo apt-get install python python-simplejson python-setuptools<br />
wget http://pygooglevoice.googlecode.com/files/pygooglevoice-0.5.tar.gz<br />
tar -zxvf pygooglevoice-0.5.tar.gz<br />
cd pygooglevoice-0.5<br />
sudo apt-get install python python-setuptools<br />
cd ~/<br />
touch bin/smsme<br />
chmod +x bin/smsme<br />
vim bin/smsme <br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
</code>

<p>Then, open vim and do a '<code>:set paste</code>'</p>
<p>paste in the code below</p>
<p>after pasting press esc and do a '<code>:set paste!</code>'</p>
<code>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
#!/usr/bin/python<br />
import sys<br />
from googlevoice import Voice<br />
from googlevoice.util import input<br />
// replace with your g-voice phone number<br />
phone_numb=5555555555<br />
voice = Voice()<br />
voice.login()<br />
text = ' '.join(sys.argv[1:])<br />
voice.send_sms(phone_numb, text)<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
</code>
<br />
<p>make any changes to the code, then do a :wq to exit</p>
<p>Also, you should edit the file in your home directory '.gvoice' and add your username and password (make sure you chmod 600 on that file though..)</p>
<p>Now, you can type in at the command line:</p>
<code>smsme &lt;message&gt;</code>
<br />
<p>For Example:</p>
<code>smsme there's a fly in your soup... i mean server. fix it!</code>
<p>You will recieve a message on your phone "there's a fly in your soup... i mean server. fix it!"</p>
<p>Stay tuned for useful uses for this smsme script.</p>
