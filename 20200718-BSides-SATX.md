### Classical Encryption

In 1500 BC a mesopotamian potter encrypted the method for making his pottery glaze and inscribed it on a clay tablet.

The ancient Hebrew people also made use of [encryption](https://faculty.washington.edu/snoegel/PDFs/articles/Noegel%2015%20-%20JBQ%201996a.pdf) utilizing a substitution cipher to encode the names of their enemies in parts of the bible as early as the 600s BC.
